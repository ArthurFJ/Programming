## How to use these notes

- Open `.ipynb` files with Jupyter or VS Code's Notebook support to run examples interactively.
- Check for a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file if examples require specific packages.
- Start with `Basics` if you're new, then proceed to `Data Structures` and `Functions` before advanced topics.
- For practice, try the small exercises and quizzes included in each section.
