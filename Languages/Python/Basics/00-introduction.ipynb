    "Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words**:\n",
    "Programming is like speaking a language that computers understand. Just as we use languages like English or Spanish to communicate with each other, we use programming languages to communicate with computers and tell them what to do. These instructions can range from simple tasks, like adding two numbers, to complex operations, like running a web server or analyzing large datasets."

    "Learning programming opens up a world of possibilities. It empowers you to create software, automate tasks, analyze data, and solve complex problems. Whether you're interested in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, or game development, programming is a fundamental skill that can lead to exciting career opportunities and personal projects."

    "#### How does Programming work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The interpretation**: Each programming language has its own environment where you write and run your code. What this means is that for the computer to understand and execute your instructions, there is something called an interpreter or compiler that translates your code into machine language. That is, the famous 0s and 1s. So, each language has its own way of being interpreted, and thus works differently.\n",
    "2. **Writing the code**: You write your instructions using the syntax and rules of the chosen programming language. This code is usually written in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). For example, for python there are editors like Google Collab, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, VSCode, etc.\n",
    "3. **Executing the code**: Once the code is written, you run it, or more precisely, you \"execute\" it. The interpreter or compiler processes your code and performs the \"magic\" behind the scenes to make the computer carry out your instructions. This means that the computer has its own brain and organs that allow it to do what you tell it to do.\n",
    "4. **Debugging and Testing**: After executing the code, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior. Debugging involves identifying and fixing these issues to ensure that the program works as intended. Testing is also crucial to verify that the program produces the correct output for various inputs. This will happen a lot, not only when you are starting, but even experienced programmers face bugs and errors regularly. Why? Because computers are very literal, and even a small mistake in the code can lead to unexpected results."

    "#### Let's make a simple example to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write down a list of instructions to make a sandwich:\n",
    "1. Get two slices of bread.\n",
    "2. Spread peanut butter on one slice.\n",
    "3. Spread jelly on the other slice.\n",
    "4. Put the two slices together.\n",
    "5. Cut the sandwich in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will this work? Of course! But only if the person following the instructions understands what \"bread\", \"peanut butter\", and \"jelly\" are, and knows how to perform the actions described. If any step is unclear or ambiguous, the result may not be what you intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did we ask to pick up the knife or spoon to spread the peanut butter? With which hand, and what part of the knife did we want to use? Did we instructed to said what the peanut butter or jelly is? No, we assumed the person already knew these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to programming. When writing code, you need to be precise and clear about what you want the computer to do. If the instructions are ambiguous or incomplete, the computer may not be able to execute them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what are the variables, what functions do we want to use, etc. All these things need to be defined and explained in the code for the computer to understand and execute it properly."
