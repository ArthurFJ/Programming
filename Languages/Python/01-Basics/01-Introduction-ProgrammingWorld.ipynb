    "This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts of computer science that precede specific language syntax. We explore what a computer program actually is, the hierarchy of programming languages (Low vs. High level), the role of compilers and interpreters, and the universal logical structures (Sequence, Selection, Iteration) that form the basis of all software development."

    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "A computer program is a collection of instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task. Formally, it is an implementation of an **Algorithm**: a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Program} = \\text{Algorithms} + \\text{Data Structures} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Other Words\n",
    "Computers are incredibly fast, but incredibly \"dumb.\" They do not have intuition. A program is simply a recipe. If you want a robot to make a sandwich, you cannot say \"make a sandwich.\" You must say:\n",
    "1. Open bag.\n",
    "2. Take slice 1.\n",
    "3. Take slice 2.\n",
    "4. Apply peanut butter to slice 1...\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is the art of breaking down a complex problem into these tiny, unambiguous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts & Terminology\n",
    "* **Input (I):** Data entering the system (Keyboard, Mouse, File).\n",
    "* **Process (P):** The calculation or manipulation of data.\n",
    "* **Output (O):** The result presented to the user (Screen, File, Sound).\n",
    "* **IPO Model:** The fundamental structure of almost all programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition: The Black Box\n",
    "Imagine a box where you throw ingredients in one side (Input), machinery inside chops and cooks them (Process), and a finished meal slides out the other side (Output). As programmers, we design the machinery inside the box."

    "\n",
    "* **Low-Level Language:** Languages that provide little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture (e.g., Assembly, Machine Code).\n",
    "* **High-Level Language:** Languages with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. They use natural language elements (e.g., Python, Java, C++).\n",

    "Since the computer only knows \"010101\", how does it understand `print(\"Hello\")`?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Compiler (e.g., C++):** Translates the *entire* book (code) into machine language *before* running. Creates an executable file.\n",
    "2.  **Interpreter (e.g., Python):** Translates the code line-by-line *while* running. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "Imagine you are reading a book in Russian, but you only speak English.\n",
    "* **Compiled:** A professional translator takes the book, translates the whole thing, and gives you a new English version. You can read it fast now.\n",
    "* **Interpreted:** You hire a translator to sit next to you. You point at a line, they translate it, you read it. Then you point to the next line. It is slower, but you can change the Russian text on the fly and keep reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing the Abstraction\n",
    "1.  **Python:** `x = y + z` (Human readable)\n",
    "2.  **Assembly:** `LOAD A`, `ADD B`, `STORE C` (Processor readable)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "1.  **Integer (`int`):** Whole numbers ($1, 5, -10$).\n",

    "### Syntax Note\n",
    "In Python, variables are created by assignment: `variable_name = value`. \n",

    "* **Variable:** You slap a sticker on a box that says \"UserAge\".\n",
    "* **Assignment:** You put the number `25` inside that box.\n",
