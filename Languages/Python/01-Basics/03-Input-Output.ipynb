    "A computer program that cannot communicate is useless. In this notebook, we explore the **Input-Process-Output (IPO)** cycle's outer layers: how to send data to the user (Output) and how to receive data from the user (Input). We will look at the `print()` and `input()` functions and the concept of \"Standard Streams.\""

    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "Output is the act of sending data from the program's memory to a display device (screen, console, or file). In Python, the primary tool for this is the `print()` function, which sends data to **Standard Output (`stdout`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax & Key Structures\n",
    "* **Basic Syntax:** `print(object)`\n",
    "* **Multiple Objects:** `print(object1, object2)` (Separated by a space by default)\n",
    "* **Parameters:**\n",
    "    * `sep=`: String inserted *between* values (Default is a space `' '`).\n",
    "    * `end=`: String appended *after* the last value (Default is a newline `\\n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "Think of `print()` as a teleportation machine. You put something inside the parentheses, and it instantly appears on the user's screen. By default, after it teleports the item, it hits the \"Enter\" key (newline) so the next message starts on a new line."

    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "Input is the act of receiving data from an external source (Keyboard) into the program. In Python, the `input()` function pauses program execution and waits for data from **Standard Input (`stdin`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "* **Basic:** `input()`\n",
    "* **With Prompt:** `input(\"Message to display: \")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works (The Mechanics)\n",
    "1.  **Prompt:** The program displays the optional message string to the user.\n",
    "2.  **Pause:** The program *stops executing* and waits.\n",
    "3.  **Listen:** The user types characters on the keyboard.\n",
    "4.  **Capture:** When the user presses `ENTER`, the program captures everything typed as a **String** (text).\n",
    "5.  **Resume:** The program continues, replacing the `input()` function with the text the user typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "Imagine a conversation. When you ask a question (`input`), you stop talking and wait. You cannot continue the conversation until the other person answers. The answer they give is then \"returned\" to you to use."

    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "How does the computer know where to \"print\" or where to \"listen\"? It uses three default data channels called **Standard Streams**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **stdin (Standard Input):** The default source of data (Keyboard).\n",
    "2.  **stdout (Standard Output):** The default destination for normal data (Monitor/Terminal).\n",
    "3.  **stderr (Standard Error):** A separate destination for error messages (Monitor/Terminal, but distinct stream).\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Other Words\n",
    "`print()` is just a wrapper (a shortcut). It secretly uses `sys.stdout`. `input()` secretly reads from `sys.stdin`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this is crucial because in advanced programming, we can \"redirect\" these streams—for example, making `print()` write to a text file instead of the screen, just by changing the destination of `stdout`."

    "* **Interactive Flow:** Programs pause for `input()` and push data via `print()`.\n",

    "* **Formatting Output:** We can control how output looks using `sep` (separator) and `end` (line ending).\n",
    "* **Streams:** Python uses `stdout` to speak and `stdin` to listen. `print` and `input` are just convenient tools to access these streams."
